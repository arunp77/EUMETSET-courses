    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing is the process of gathering information about the Earth's surface and atmosphere from a distance, typically using sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, drones, or other platforms. This technology allows us to collect data and images without making direct physical contact with the target area.\n",

    "The basic idea behind remote sensing is to capture electromagnetic radiation (light) reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. This radiation carries valuable information about the characteristics of objects and the environment. Here's a brief overview of how remote sensing is done:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy Source**: Remote sensing starts with an energy source, usually the sun. The sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, infrared, and microwaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interaction with Earth**: When this energy reaches the Earth, it interacts with the surface and atmosphere. Different materials reflect, absorb, and emit energy in various ways depending on their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sensors and Detectors**: Remote sensing instruments, such as cameras, spectrometers, and radiometers, are used to detect and record the energy that interacts with the Earth's surface. These instruments are often mounted on satellites or aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Transmission**: The collected data is transmitted to receiving stations on Earth. For satellite-based remote sensing, the data is sent via radio signals to ground stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Processing**: The raw data collected by remote sensing instruments often need to be processed to create meaningful images and information. This involves removing noise, calibrating the data, and applying algorithms to extract specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Image Interpretation and Analysis**: The processed data is transformed into images and other visualizations. Remote sensing experts interpret these images to extract information about land cover, vegetation, urban development, geological features, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Applications**: Remote sensing has numerous applications in various fields, including agriculture, forestry, environmental monitoring, disaster management, urban planning, archaeology, and climate studies. For example, it can be used to monitor changes in deforestation, track the movement of pollutants, assess crop health, and predict natural disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing relies on the principle that different materials and objects interact with energy in unique ways, which allows us to differentiate and understand various features on the Earth's surface. Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible, infrared, microwave, etc.) provide distinct information about different characteristics of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning remote sensing in detail involves understanding the physics of electromagnetic radiation, sensor technologies, data acquisition techniques, image processing, and the interpretation of the acquired data. It can be a complex but rewarding field of study with wide-ranging applications."

    "\n",
    "Remote sensing utilizes various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to gather information about the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses a wide range of wavelengths, each carrying unique information about different materials and phenomena. Here are some key regions of the electromagnetic spectrum commonly used in remote sensing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visible Light**: This is the portion of the spectrum that human eyes can perceive. It ranges from approximately 400 to 700 nanometers (nm). Visible light is used to capture color information and is crucial for identifying features like land cover, vegetation types, and urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Near-Infrared (NIR)**: Just beyond the visible spectrum, ranging from around 700 to 1400 nm. NIR radiation is often used to assess plant health and vegetation density. Healthy vegetation reflects a lot of NIR radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shortwave Infrared (SWIR)**: Extending from about 1400 to 3000 nm. SWIR radiation is sensitive to changes in mineral composition and moisture content. It can be used to identify specific minerals and detect alterations in surface materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mid-Infrared (MIR)**: Ranging from approximately 3000 to 8000 nm. MIR radiation can provide insights into temperature variations and surface properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Thermal Infrared (TIR)**: Extending from about 8000 to 15000 nm. TIR radiation is emitted by objects based on their temperature. This region is used to capture temperature variations across the landscape, which is useful for studies involving heat distribution, thermal anomalies, and energy balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Microwave**: Microwaves have longer wavelengths than visible light, ranging from millimeters to centimeters. Microwave remote sensing is sensitive to surface roughness, moisture content, and certain subsurface features. This region is used in radar systems for mapping terrain, detecting ocean currents, and studying soil moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Radio Waves**: With even longer wavelengths, radio waves are used for communication and positioning (e.g., GPS), but they also have remote sensing applications such as passive radio astronomy to study celestial objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different remote sensing technologies and instruments are designed to capture and analyze radiation within these specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each region provides unique insights into different aspects of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, allowing scientists and researchers to study various phenomena and make informed decisions across a wide range of fields.\n",

    "### Interaction with Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "Electromagnetic energy, produced by the vibration of charged particles, travels in the form of waves through the atmosphere and the vacuum of space. These waves have different wavelengths and frequencies; a shorter wavelength means a higher frequency. Some, like radio, microwave, and infrared waves, have a longer wavelength, while others, such as ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, have a much shorter wavelength. Visible light sits in the middle of that range of long to shortwave radiation. This small portion of energy is all that the human eye is able to detect. Instrumentation is needed to detect all other forms of electromagnetic energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Image/spectrum-1.png\" alt=\"Your Image\" style=\"max-width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some waves are absorbed or reflected by atmospheric components, like water vapor and carbon dioxide, while some wavelengths allow for unimpeded movement through the atmosphere; visible light has wavelengths that can be transmitted through the atmosphere. Microwave energy has wavelengths that can pass through clouds, an attribute utilized by many weather and communication satellites.\n",
    "- The primary source of the energy observed by satellites, is the Sun. The amount of the Sun’s energy reflected depends on the roughness of the surface and its albedo, which is how well a surface reflects light instead of absorbing it. \n",
    "  - Snow, for example, has a very high albedo and reflects up to 90% of incoming solar radiation. \n",
    "  - The ocean, on the other hand, reflects only about 6% of incoming solar radiation and absorbs the rest. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Often, when energy is absorbed, it is re-emitted, usually at longer wavelengths. For example, the energy absorbed by the ocean gets re-emitted as infrared radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All things on Earth reflect, absorb, or transmit energy, the amount of which varies by wavelength. Just as your fingerprint is unique to you, everything on Earth has a unique spectral fingerprint. Researchers can use this information to identify different Earth features as well as different rock and mineral types. \n",
    "  - The number of spectral bands detected by a given instrument, its spectral resolution, determines how much differentiation a researcher can identify between materials."

    "\n",
    "The collection process for satellite datasets involves several steps. Here is a general overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Satellite Launch:** Satellites are launched into space and placed into specific orbits around the Earth. These satellites are equipped with sensors and instruments to capture data about the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and other phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Acquisition:** Once in orbit, satellites start collecting data by capturing images, measurements, or other types of observations. The sensors on board the satellite record information about various aspects of the Earth, such as land cover, vegetation, weather patterns, or ocean currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Transmission:** The collected data is transmitted from the satellite to ground stations on Earth. This can be done through various communication methods, including radio waves or laser beams. Ground stations receive the data and process it for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Processing:** After receiving the data, it undergoes processing to correct for any distortions or errors introduced during the collection and transmission process. This may involve calibration, georeferencing, or atmospheric correction to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Storage and Distribution:** Processed satellite data is stored in databases or archives for easy access and retrieval. These datasets are often made available to researchers, scientists, government agencies, and other users through online platforms or data portals.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Analysis and Interpretation:** Users can analyze the satellite data to extract valuable information and insights. This can involve various techniques, such as image processing, data fusion, or statistical analysis. The data is used to study and monitor changes in the Earth's environment, track weather patterns, assess natural disasters, or support decision-making processes in various fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the specific details of the satellite data collection process can vary depending on the satellite mission, sensor technology, and data requirements. Different satellites may have different resolutions, spectral bands, or temporal coverage, allowing for a wide range of applications and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in collecting satellite data\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in collecting satellite observations can vary depending on the specific objectives and requirements of the mission. Here are some common KPIs used in satellite data collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coverage:** This KPI measures the extent of the Earth's surface that is observed by the satellite. It indicates the spatial coverage and distribution of the collected data. Higher coverage indicates a more comprehensive view of the Earth's features and phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resolution:** Resolution refers to the level of detail captured by the satellite sensors. It is typically measured in terms of spatial resolution (the smallest discernible feature on the ground) and spectral resolution (the number and width of spectral bands captured). Higher resolution enables the detection of smaller objects or finer details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Frequency:** Temporal frequency measures how often the satellite revisits a specific location on Earth. It indicates the frequency at which observations are made, allowing for the monitoring of dynamic processes and changes over time. Higher temporal frequency provides more frequent updates and enables the tracking of short-term variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accuracy:** Accuracy measures the degree of agreement between the satellite observations and ground truth data or reference measurements. It assesses the reliability and precision of the collected data. Higher accuracy ensures the trustworthiness of the observations and their suitability for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Latency:** Data latency refers to the time delay between data acquisition by the satellite and its availability for users. It measures how quickly the collected data is processed, validated, and made accessible. Lower data latency ensures timely access to the observations, which is crucial for time-sensitive applications like weather forecasting or disaster monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Quality:** Data quality assesses the overall reliability, consistency, and completeness of the collected observations. It considers factors such as sensor calibration, atmospheric correction, and data validation procedures. Higher data quality ensures that the observations are free from errors, artifacts, or biases, making them suitable for accurate analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These KPIs help evaluate the performance and effectiveness of satellite data collection missions, ensuring that the observations meet the intended objectives and user requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Satellite data collection levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Within remote sensing and it's applications there are a series of levels that are used to define the amount of processing that has been performed to provide a given dataset. Satellite data is collected at various levels, each representing a different stage of processing and refinement. Here are the common levels of satellite data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Level 0 (L0):** This is raw data directly from the satellite's sensors and refers to full resolution data,. It includes unprocessed digital counts or voltage measurements. L0 data is transmitted to ground stations. It is unlikely you will work with this level of data, especially for more modern sensors, as this data lack information such as geo-referencing and time-referencing ancillary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Level 1 (L1):** L1 data is generated by applying basic corrections to L0 data. It includes georeferencing, radiometric calibration, and removal of sensor-specific artifacts. The output is still in sensor units. This level also includes quality and classification flags. **Example:** for ocean colour this would be often referred to as the “top of atmosphere” radiance [mW.m-2.sr-1.nm-1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Level 2 (L2):** At this level, L1 data is further processed to convert sensor units into physical units (e.g., radiance or reflectance). Atmospheric corrections may also be applied to account for the influence of the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Level 3 (L3):** L3 data involves data products that are geographically gridded or mapped. This level often includes time-averaged or composited data to create datasets suitable for broader scientific analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Level 4 (L4):** L4 data represents higher-level data products derived from multiple satellites or sources. It can include global climate datasets, reanalysis data, or models that assimilate satellite observations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of collecting raw data from satellite sensors, \"voltage values\" refer to one of the ways that certain types of sensors record measurements. When a sensor detects a physical quantity, such as light intensity or temperature, it often generates an electrical signal proportional to that quantity. This electrical signal is typically in the form of voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensor Output:** Satellite sensors are designed to capture various types of data, such as imagery, temperature, or radiation levels. When these sensors interact with the environment, they produce an electrical signal that corresponds to the measured quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Voltage as a Signal:** In many cases, this electrical signal is in the form of voltage. The magnitude of the voltage signal is directly related to the quantity being measured. For example, in an optical sensor, the amount of light detected can be translated into a voltage signal where higher light intensity corresponds to higher voltage values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion:** Before transmitting the data, the analog voltage signal is often converted into a digital representation. This process is called analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). In ADC, the continuous analog voltage is sampled at discrete intervals and assigned digital values (digital counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Digital Counts:** These digital values, referred to as \"digital counts\" or simply \"counts,\" are then transmitted as part of the raw data. Each count represents a specific voltage level recorded by the sensor during its measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you have an optical sensor on a satellite that measures sunlight intensity, it might generate voltage values as it detects varying levels of sunlight. These voltage values are then digitized and transmitted as part of the raw data to ground stations or receivers for further processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, \"voltage values\" in this context refer to the electrical signals generated by satellite sensors to represent the physical quantities they are designed to measure. These signals are converted into digital counts for transmission and subsequent data processing."

Reflectance is usually expressed as a dimensionless value between 0 and 1, but it can be multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n",

The process involves several steps, including atmospheric correction and radiative transfer modeling. Here's an overview of how surface temperature is calculated from radiance data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Radiance Measurement:**\n",
    "   - Radiance data is collected by remote sensing instruments operating in the TIR spectral range. These sensors capture the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth's surface in the form of radiance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Atmospheric Correction:**\n",
    "   - Atmospheric correction is a critical step because the atmosphere absorbs and scatters thermal radiation. To calculate surface temperature accurately, you need to remove the atmospheric effects. This is typically done using radiative transfer models or atmospheric profile data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emissivity Correction:**\n",
    "   - Surface emissivity is a measure of how efficiently a surface emits thermal radiation. It can vary depending on the material and the wavelength of observation. To calculate surface temperature, you need to know or estimate the emissivity of the surface in the TIR band. Emissivity values are typically assigned based on land cover classes or measured in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Planck's Law:**\n",
    "   - Planck's law describes the relationship between radiance, temperature, wavelength, and emissivity. It is used to relate the radiance measured by the sensor to the surface temperature and emissivity. The formula for Planck's law is:\n",

    "   - Calculating surface temperature from radiance data involves an iterative optimization process. Given the measured radiance, known or estimated emissivity, and the Planck's law equation, an iterative optimization algorithm is used to find the temperature that best fits the observed radiance. This is typically done for each pixel in the image.\n",

    "- **Geostationary orbit (GEO):** Satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) circle Earth above the equator from west to east following Earth’s rotation – taking 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds – by travelling at exactly the same rate as Earth. This makes satellites in GEO appear to be ‘stationary’ over a fixed position. In order to perfectly match Earth’s rotation, the speed of GEO satellites should be about 3 km per second at an altitude of 35 786 km. This is much farther from Earth’s surface compared to many satellites.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - GEO is used by satellites that need to stay constantly above one particular place over Earth, such as telecommunication satellites. This way, an antenna on Earth can be fixed to always stay pointed towards that satellite without moving. It can also be used by weather monitoring satellites, because they can continually observe specific areas to see how weather trends emerge there.\n",
    "    - Satellites in GEO cover a large range of Earth so as few as three equally-spaced satellites can provide near global coverage. This is because when a satellite is this far from Earth, it can cover large sections at once. This is akin to being able to see more of a map from a metre away compared with if you were a centimetre from it. So to see all of Earth at once from GEO far fewer satellites are needed than at a lower altitude.\n",
    "    - ESA’s European Data Relay System (EDRS) programme has placed satellites in GEO, where they relay information to and from non-GEO satellites and other stations that are otherwise unable to permanently transmit or receive data. This means Europe can always stay connected and online.\n",

    "- **Low Earth orbit (LEO):** A low Earth orbit (LEO) is, as the name suggests, an orbit that is relatively close to Earth’s surface. It is normally at an altitude of less than 1000 km but could be as low as 160 km above Earth – which is low compared to other orbits, but still very far above Earth’s surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By comparison, most commercial aeroplanes do not fly at altitudes much greater than approximately 14 km, so even the lowest LEO is more than ten times higher than that.\n",
    "    - Unlike satellites in GEO that must always orbit along Earth’s equator, LEO satellites do not always have to follow a particular path around Earth in the same way – their plane can be tilted. This means there are more available routes for satellites in LEO, which is one of the reasons why LEO is a very commonly used orbit.\n",
    "    - LEO’s close proximity to Earth makes it useful for several reasons. It is the orbit most commonly used for satellite imaging, as being near the surface allows it to take images of higher resolution. It is also the orbit used for the International Space Station (ISS), as it is easier for astronauts to travel to and from it at a shorter distance. Satellites in this orbit travel at a speed of around 7.8 km per second; at this speed, a satellite takes approximately 90 minutes to circle Earth, meaning the ISS travels around Earth about 16 times a day.\n",
    "    - However, individual LEO satellites are less useful for tasks such as telecommunication, because they move so fast across the sky and therefore require a lot of effort to track from ground stations.\n",
    "    - Instead, communications satellites in LEO often work as part of a large combination or constellation, of multiple satellites to give constant coverage. In order to increase coverage, sometimes constellations like this, consisting of several of the same or similar satellites, are launched together to create a ‘net’ around Earth. This lets them cover large areas of Earth simultaneously by working together.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - It is very commonly used by navigation satellites, like the European Galileo system (pictured). Galileo powers navigation communications across Europe, and is used for many types of navigation, from tracking large jumbo jets to getting directions to your smartphone. Galileo uses a constellation of multiple satellites to provide coverage across large parts of the world all at once.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Satellites in a polar orbit do not have to pass the North and South Pole precisely; even a deviation within 20 to 30 degrees is still classed as a polar orbit. Polar orbits are a type of low Earth orbit, as they are at low altitudes between 200 to 1000 km.\n",
    "    - **Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO)** is a particular kind of polar orbit. Satellites in SSO, travelling over the polar regions, are synchronous with the Sun. This means they are synchronised to always be in the same ‘fixed’ position relative to the Sun. This means that the satellite always visits the same spot at the same local time – for example, passing the city of Paris every day at noon exactly.\n",
    "    - This means that the satellite will always observe a point on the Earth as if constantly at the same time of the day, which serves a number of applications; for example, it means that scientists and those who use the satellite images can compare how somewhere changes over time.\n",
    "    - This is because, if you want to monitor an area by taking a series of images of a certain place across many days, weeks, months, or even years, then it would not be very helpful to compare somewhere at midnight and then at midday – you need to take each picture as similarly as the previous picture as possible. Therefore, scientists use image series like these to investigate how weather patterns emerge, to help predict weather or storms; when monitoring emergencies like forest fires or flooding; or to accumulate data on long-term problems like deforestation or rising sea levels.\n",
    "    - Often, satellites in SSO are synchronised so that they are in constant dawn or dusk – this is because by constantly riding a sunset or sunrise, they will never have the Sun at an angle where the Earth shadows them. A satellite in a Sun-synchronous orbit would usually be at an altitude of between 600 to 800 km. At 800 km, it will be travelling at a speed of approximately 7.5 km per second.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Transfer orbits and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO):** Transfer orbits are a special kind of orbit used to get from one orbit to another. When satellites are launched from Earth and carried to space with launch vehicles such as Ariane 5, the satellites are not always placed directly on their final orbit. Often, the satellites are instead placed on a transfer orbit: an orbit where, by using relatively little energy from built-in motors, the satellite or spacecraft can move from one orbit to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This allows a satellite to reach, for example, a high-altitude orbit like GEO without actually needing the launch vehicle to go all the way to this altitude, which would require more effort – this is like taking a shortcut. Reaching GEO in this way is an example of one of the most common transfer orbits, called the geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).\n",
    "    - Orbits have different eccentricities – a measure of how circular (round) or elliptical (squashed) an orbit is. In a perfectly round orbit, the satellite is always at the same distance from the Earth’s surface – but on a highly eccentric orbit, the path looks like an ellipse.\n",
    "    - On a highly eccentric orbit like this, the satellite can quickly go from being very far to very near Earth’s surface depending on where the satellite is on the orbit. In transfer orbits, the payload uses engines to go from an orbit of one eccentricity to another, which puts it on track to higher or lower orbits.\n",
    "    - After liftoff, a launch vehicle makes its way to space following a path shown by the yellow line, in the figure. At the target destination, the rocket releases the payload which sets it off on an elliptical orbit, following the blue line which sends the payload farther away from Earth. The point farthest away from the Earth on the blue elliptical orbit is called the apogee and the point closest is called the perigee. \n",
    "    - When the payload reaches the apogee at the GEO altitude of 35 786 km, it fires its engines in such a way that it enters onto the circular GEO orbit and stays there, shown by the red line in the diagram. So, specifically, the GTO is the blue path from the yellow orbit to the red orbit.\n",

    "- **Lagrange points (L-points):** For many spacecraft being put in orbit, being too close to Earth can be disruptive to their mission – even at more distant orbits such as GEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For example, for space-based observatories and telescopes whose mission is to photograph deep, dark space, being next to Earth is hugely detrimental because Earth naturally emits visible light and infrared radiation that will prevent the telescope from detecting any faint lights like distant galaxies. Photographing dark space with a telescope next to our glowing Earth would be as hopeless as trying to take pictures of stars from Earth in broad daylight.\n",
    "    - Lagrange points, or L-points, allow for orbits that are much, much farther away (over a million kilometres) and do not orbit Earth directly. These are specific points far out in space where the gravitational fields of Earth and the Sun combine in such a way that spacecraft that orbit them remain stable and can thus be ‘anchored’ relative to Earth. If a spacecraft was launched to other points in space very distant from Earth, they would naturally fall into an orbit around the Sun, and those spacecraft would soon end up far from Earth, making communication difficult. Instead, spacecraft launched to these special L-points stay fixed, and remain close to Earth with minimal effort without going into a different orbit.\n",
    "    - The most used L-points are L1 and L2. These are both four times farther away from Earth than the Moon – 1.5 million km, compared to GEO’s 36 000 km – but that is still only approximately 1% of the distance of Earth from the Sun.\n",
